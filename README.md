# COVID-19-Pneumonia-Classification-
Lung Disease Classification with Hyperparameter Tuning
Overview
This project aims to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, Normal, and Pneumonia. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized for this classification task. The model includes enhancements such as data augmentation, normalization, and hyperparameter optimization using Keras Tuner to improve performance and architecture.

Features
